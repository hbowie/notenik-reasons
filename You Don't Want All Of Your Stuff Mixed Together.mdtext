Title:  You Don't Want All Of Your Stuff Mixed Together

Seq:    10

Level:  2

Body:

Some apps mix all of your stuff together in a single location. 

Notenik supports that. 

But it also supports you organizing your stuff into as many different folders (i.e. *collections*) as you would like. 

So you can have different collections for different purposes. 

Each with their own kinds of stuff.
