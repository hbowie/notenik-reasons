Title:  You Like Text

Body:

Numbers have their place. And pictures are nice too. 

And Notenik doesn't leave you out in the cold if you want to incude either of those things. 

But in our opinion there's nothing like the open-ended expressiveness of text when you want to document an idea or a description or just a plain old fact. 

So text is always front and center when you fire up Notenik.
