Body:

A wiki link uses a special syntax (double square brackets) to create an internal link from one note to another within a collection. There's a special keyboard shortcut to allow the user to quickly select the note to be linked to. 

Wiki links allow the user to quickly scoot around from one note to another within a collection.
